<h2>More About Me</h2>
<div class="card">
<p>
To be up front, I'm a bit of a nerd.

<br><br>
<h4>My History with Programming</h4>
When I'm not coding or mentoring, I enjoy gaming, 
exploring new technologies, and spending time with friends and family.
To get into depth about programming, I started programming about ~8 years ago. 
I actually really hate web design, so this site is as minimal as I could muster. I started with Python coding
Discord bots, then moved into Java for Minecraft mods and plugins. I mainly use Java for FRC and MC mods and plugins.
I still try to use python for my small scripts so I don't lose touch with it. I also dabbled in C++ for a bit when I was in VEX robotics.
I use bash scripting for server management and automation in my homelab.

<br><br>
<h4>Hobbies</h4>
In my free time, I enjoy gaming, watching movies, and doing photography. I play a lot of Minecraft, GTAV, and Fallout games. 
I watch movies and tend to rate them and contribute to IMDB. I've rated 148 movies and shows so far.
I also enjoy building and maintaining my homelab, experimenting with different server setups and networking configurations.
I host various services like game servers for friends, media servers like Jellyfin, and web applications.
I use Jellyfin to stream my movie collection of 300+ movies and 1000+ episodes of TV shows.

<br><br>
<h4>Personal Life</h4>
I graduated high school in 2025 and currently mentor an FRC team which I was a part of during high school. 
In 2025, my team won the Rookie All-Star Award at the Indiana District Layfette Event, which was a huge accomplishment for us.
And I've been chasing that high ever since. Which is part of why I love mentoring now.
Over my summer I worked as an IT intern, gaining hands-on experience in the IT field, which was an incredibly valuable experience.
In the end, I hope to work 
in software development or IT role.
